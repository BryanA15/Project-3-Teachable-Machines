    <!-- Project Objective -->
    <section>
        <h2>Project Objective</h2>
        <p>Our project aimed to create a teachable machine for image recognition while exploring ethical and societal implications of AI development.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Project Scope -->
    <section>
        <h2>Project Scope</h2>
        <p>The teachable machine was trained to identify images of objects such as seashells, rocks, and turtles. Our focus extended beyond technical accuracy to consider the fairness and inclusivity of our dataset and model.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Process -->
    <section>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>We gathered a diverse dataset, trained our model on Teachable Machine, and tested its performance using both controlled and live inputs. The process included iterative testing and adjustment for better accuracy and reduced bias.</p>

    <!-- Lessons Learned -->
    <section>
        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>
            We learned the importance of:
            <ul>
                <li>Auditing datasets for bias and demographic representation.</li>
                <li>Transparency in documenting AI development processes.</li>
                <li>Collaborating with diverse perspectives to ensure inclusivity.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
